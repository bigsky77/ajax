Welcome to Ajax!

Ajax is a text based adventure game to leverages the power of the CLI and the Rust stark-rs library to create a simple interface for interacting with Cairo smart contracts. 

Users upload their wallet and key and then create a character.  This character is deployed as a Cairo smart contract.  Individual decisions players make affect the state of the player and the smart contract itself.  When the player encounters an enemy a new enemy contract is deployed.  

When they enter battle, the player users the battle.cairo contract to interact with the enemy contract.
